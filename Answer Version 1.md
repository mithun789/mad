## QUESTION 02 - UI/UX Design and Analysis (25 Marks)

### a) Evaluation and Recommendation (10 Marks)

**Evaluation of Approach A (Feature-Rich Dashboard):**

**Disadvantages:**
- Overwhelming for mainstream users who represent the majority
- Violates simplicity principles - complexity makes it unsustainable
- Difficult to use in mobile environments (busy streets, one-handed use, quick tasks)
- Creates cognitive overload - users must process 12 options before taking action
- Poor emotional experience - users feel stressed rather than organized
- Designed for experts, not the mainstream majority
- Increased development and maintenance costs

**Advantages:**
- All features immediately visible
- May appeal to tech-savvy users who want quick access to everything

---

**Evaluation of Approach B (Simple Home Screen):**

**Advantages:**
- Follows simplicity principles - focuses on core user needs
- Designed for mainstreamers (majority users) who "just want the app to work"
- Reduces cognitive load - users see only what matters most
- Better for mobile environments (outdoor shopping, quick in-store use)
- Emotional benefit - users feel organized and in control, not overwhelmed
- Easier navigation - fewer taps to complete primary tasks
- Follows industry best practices (progressive disclosure)
- Lower maintenance costs and cleaner codebase

**Disadvantages:**
- Additional features require extra navigation step
- May frustrate expert users initially

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Approach B (Simple Home Screen)** ✅

**Justification:**

1. **Mainstream User Focus:** The majority of grocery shoppers are mainstreamers who want efficiency. They need to search products, manage their cart, track orders, and browse categories - these 4 features cover 90% of use cases.

2. **Mobile Context Consideration:**
   - **In-store usage:** Users need quick product lookup and cart access while shopping
   - **At home:** Users want to browse and plan orders without distraction
   - **Time-constrained:** Busy professionals need fast task completion

3. **Emotional Needs:** Shopping should feel simple and stress-free. A cluttered interface creates anxiety, especially for elderly users. Approach B provides clarity and confidence.

4. **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features (Loyalty Points, Store Locator, Recipes) are available through a menu for those who need them, without cluttering the main interface.

5. **Business Value:** Higher user satisfaction leads to better retention and more completed purchases. Users who feel overwhelmed abandon apps.

6. **Evidence-Based:** As stated in lectures - "Mass appeal comes from focusing on the mainstream." The Model T succeeded by serving the majority, not the experts.

### b) 60-30-10 Color Rule Application (7 Marks)

**Primary Color (60%) - Background and Main Surfaces:**
- **Choice:** Soft white or light gray (#F5F5F5)
- **Usage:** App background, product card backgrounds, main content areas
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Creates clean, uncluttered space for product images to stand out
  - Reduces eye strain during extended browsing
  - Communicates freshness and cleanliness (appropriate for groceries)
  - Ensures product photos display accurately without color interference

**Secondary Color (30%) - Supporting Elements:**
- **Choice:** Fresh green (#4CAF50) or warm orange (#
